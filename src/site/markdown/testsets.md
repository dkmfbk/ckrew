Testsets
===

This page links to the sets of synthetic CKRs used in the evaluation of the CKRew
implementation.  

## TS1: Scalability evaluation

Testset for the evaluation of requested time for inference
closure computation with respect to the number and size of contexts of a CKR.  
3 generations of this testset have been produced.

## TS2: Defeasibility evaluation

Testset for the evaluation of amount of time requested for inference closure computation 
with respect to the percentage of global defeasible axioms and their overridings.  
5 generations of this testset have been produced.
